# MAX31855_Arduino_Library

[![Say Thanks](https://img.shields.io/badge/Say%20Thanks-!-1EAEDB.svg)](https://saythanks.io/to/leemangeo)

A driver for the MAX31855 thermocouple digitizer. Based upon concepts from both
the [Adafruit](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-MAX31855-library) and
[SparkFun](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_MAX31855K_Thermocouple_Breakout_Arduino_Library)
libraries. It works well on the M0 (unlike the SparkFun library), but has some
SPI goodness that is consistent and not branded in the class names.
